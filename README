This repository contains code related to the 9ML language being developed by the
INCF Task Force for a Standard Language in Neural Network Modeling
(http://www.incf.org/core/programs/modeling).

The repository is structured as follows:

- catalog:         contains abstraction layer definition files
- code_generation: contains tools for converting abstraction layer files to other formats
- lib9ml:          contains code for reading, writing and generally working with 9ML
                   abstraction- and user-layer files.
